# Getting started
The suggested steps for starting your Rust journey.

## A Rust Environment.
It is important to have a Rust environment where you can experiment with Rust code as you come across examples. There are multiple options for how to do this. You can...
- Install Rust locally following the instructions in [the book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch01-01-installation.html).
- Use a dev-container. A bare bones dev-container setup (with instructions) can be found [here](https://github.com/Syncroness-Inc/rust-dev-container).
- Use the [Rust playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/). This is a great option for doing small scale examples but is not meant for actual development.

## Reading the book
The common starting point for Rust developers is [The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch01-01-installation.html). The book is a great place to learn core concepts and become proficient with the language.

## Rustlings Exercises
In addition to reading the book, it is suggested that you do all of the [rustlings exercises](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings). This is a great thing to do while reading the book. It will get you used to seeing compiler error messages and hopefully make chapters within the book more memorable.

## Watch the Crust of Rust
If you prefer watching videos, or just need a break from reading, consider watching the [Crust of Rust](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqbS7AVVErFiWDOAVrPt7aYmnuuOLYvOa). This video series walks though some of the intermediate aspects of the language that you are likely to come across during implementation.
