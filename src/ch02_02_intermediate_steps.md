# Intermediate Steps
Suggested learning steps that should be attempted after starting/completing the steps in the [Getting Started](ch02_01_getting_started.md) chapter.

- Complete our [internal reverse bits exercise](http://bitbucket.syncroness.com:7990/projects/SYN/repos/rust_exercise_reversebits/browse)
- Find a small program that you have written in the past and write it in Rust.
- Make a small contribution to open source using Rust.
- Try the `Beer Song`, `High Scores`, and `Reverse String` exercises on [exercism.io](https://exercism.io/tracks/rust). Try to use Rust features to solve the problems. Be sure to look at the community solutions for best practices.
