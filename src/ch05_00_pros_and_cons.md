| Rusts safety guarantees\. Every pointer dereference is guaranteed to be valid and data races are not possible\. These guarantees are provided at compile time with no cost to performance\.                               | The learning curve to Rust is steep\. The rules of ownership and lifetimes can take a while to get used to\.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| The performance of Rust is comparable to C\\C\+\+                                                                                                                                                                         | There is little vendor support for Rust\. Trying to do a project 100% using Rust may not currently be feasible when needing to interact with a large C\\C\+\+ framework like Qt\. In this case, it would be best to have the C\\C\+\+ framework call Rust rather than trying to have Rust call the framework\. |
| Standardized build system and dependency management\. Getting your code to compile in Rust is incredibly easy and always 100% reproducible\.                                                                              | There are many libraries with varying degrees of quality\. Picking a library to use within our project should be done with care\.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| The documentation, community, and educational resources surrounding the language are incredible\.                                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Documentation \(like doxygen\) and unit testing ship with the language\.                                                                                                                                                  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Generic types and high level abstractions\. It is easier to write very functional code with fewer lines\.                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Low level control\. Rust gives you low level bit operations that you are used to in C\\C\+\+\.                                                                                                                            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Helpful compiler error messages\. Rust is truly in its own league when it comes to compiler error messages\. It almost always offers an explanation for why code is not compiling and will sometimes suggest a solution\. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Many off the shelf Rust libraries to choose from on crates\.io\.                                                                                                                                                          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
