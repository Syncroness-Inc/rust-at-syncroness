# Rust at Syncroness
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) is a (relatively) new systems programming language originating at the Mozilla Foundation. Rust regularly tops the [Stack Overflow developer's survey](https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/06/05/why-the-developers-who-use-rust-love-it-so-much/) as the most-loved language, is now at the core of Mozilla Firefox, and is increasingly being put to use by both large and small tech companies. It offers performance similar to C or C++, the ability to run on bare-metal embedded platforms, "zero cost" abstractions that allow higher level programming than C, a modern type system, memory safety without garbage collection, integrated unit testing, and a standard build and dependency-management system. All of which makes it an attractive language for embedded systems development, and for some desktop applications.

At Syncroness, we've worked hard to be at or near the cutting edge of embedded software development. Our deployment of automated testing for embedded systems started earlier than many others in the industry, which has allowed us to deliver better software and to do so more quickly than our competitors. With Rust, we have another opportunity to join the cutting edge of embedded software development. And an opportunity to develop using a language that's fun to use, works at a higher level than C, doesn't have the complexity of modern C++, and is arguably safer than both.

This book is meant to serve as an entry point to the language. We will...
- Provide a recommended path for learning Rust. 
- Provide examples for how to use Rust for Syncroness's use cases. 
- Point to additional resources so you may continue to grow your Rust expertise.
- Answer commonly asked questions when trying to decide whether to use Rust or not.
- Provide some pros and cons when using Rust.
