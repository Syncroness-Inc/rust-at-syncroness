# Advanced Steps
Contribute to open source. When deciding of whether or not to contribute to a project consider the following questions.

- Does the open source project interest you?
- Is the architecture documented?
- Are there any contributing instructions?
- Is there a tool you particularly like but feel it could be better if it had a specific feature?
- Does the open source project have continuous integration?
- As a Syncroness employee, is the contribution valuable to the company?

If you answered yes to many of these questions, consider contributing to the open source project.
